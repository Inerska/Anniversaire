## Anniversaire - Never forget the birthday of a loved one again

---

The name *Anniversaire* comes from the same french word, which means *birthday*. Anniversaire is a .NET MAUI application aiming to be cross-platform and linked to a few external APIs such as Google Calendar and so on.

As a user, you have to store only once the birth date and the name of the somebody you want to remember the date for. And you don't have to touch anything else.

The day T, you will get an alert from the service you linked, notifying you that it's their birthday.
